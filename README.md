# Alura Challenge BI 
# Week 02: Marketing Challenge - Alura Shop #

Alura Shop invested in digital advertisement and the company's management has doubts if the return of this advertisement had an effect. Our mission is to support management in its decisions, and clarify doubts.
We developed a strategic marketing dashboard in order to monitor a paid advertising campaign during the month of July 2021. We will present relevant indicators for the strategic validation of the business.
